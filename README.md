### cloning the repository

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), if it's not already installed.
2. [Install Git LFS (Large File Storage)](https://help.github.com/articles/installing-git-large-file-storage/). This is needed for fetching the large media files which are stored in a separate place on GitHub's servers (for optimized repository size and access time).
3. From the command line: `git clone https://github.com/LabyrinthMadness/LabyrinthMadness.git` (or you can use a Git graphical client like [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/).
4. You should be able to open Unity and select the LabyrinthMadness repository.

### updating the repository

This is for command line usage, but you can find similar instructions for GUI clients.

Whenever you want to share your changes or see new changes from others you should do the following:

1. `git add . && git commit -m "Voici ce que j'ai fait"`
2. `git pull` (To fetch the latest changes from the server)
3. `git push origin master`
